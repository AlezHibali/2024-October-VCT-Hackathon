This versatility allows him to understand and coordinate the needs of both offensive and defensive playstyles.\n\n# Team Strategy\n\n*<h3>Agent Composition</h3>*\n\n- The team has a balanced distribution of agents across all roles - 2 Duelists, 1 Initiator, 1 Controller, 1 Sentinel.\n- This composition allows for strong executes onto sites with the duelists creating space, initiator gathering information, and controller locking down angles.\n- On defense, the controller and sentinel can set up utility to stall pushes while the duelists and initiator rotate to apply pressure.\n\n*<h3>Playing Style</h3>*\n\n- With three aggressive players (ChiaWei, XyuS, Maple), the team can play a proactive style focused on taking map control early.\n- The duelists and initiator can work together to gain information and create openings for the team to capitalize on.\n- v1c and wackie provide stability on defense and can enable retakes if the aggressive players are neutralized.\n\n*<h3>Consistency and Adaptability</h3>*\n\n- Having players from SEA, NA, and EU brings diverse perspectives and playstyles that can make the team less predictable.\n- The flexibility of ChiaWei and Maple to play multiple roles allows the team to adapt strategies based on the map or opponent.\n\n# Strength and Weakness\n*<h3>Strengths</h3>*\n- Strength1: Aggressive playstyle and strong individual skill across all roles, especially the duelists, can overwhelm opponents.\n- Strength2: Versatility in agent composition allows for dynamic strategies and unpredictability.\n- Strength3: Regional diversity provides unique perspectives and approaches to the game.\n\n*<h3>Weaknesses</h3>*\n- Weakness1: Overly aggressive playstyle could be exploited by disciplined teams that can trade effectively.\n- Weakness2: Communication challenges across different regions may impact coordination.
